# Verus AntiCheat SourceCode
### (VOSP) Verus-Open-Source-Project
!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

There is still shit to be done, but most stuff is there already.

# Why are you doing this?
I'm doing this because i won't watch how they continue scamming their customer. So you have 3 options,
- Shut Verus down
- Ignore this (and I won't stop)
- Pay me 350$ to stop this.


Verus is a complete scam. There's absolutely no way to deny this. In this repository, you'll find some of the worst checks to ever be sold in a "premium" AntiCheat, though the verus developers don't see it that way. One of the Verus developers himself, Jacob, called Verus one of the best AntiCheats.

# Why Verus is a scam

### Infrequent Updates
  - Verus lacks updates, severely. When it does update, critical issues are not fixed, exploits are not patched, and the plugin is as bad as ever. Verus updated days ago, after around 3 and a half months of being completely MIA. This was only due to the encouragement of a good friend of mine, Aidan, and had been worked on for less than a day. This is proven given the content of the updates - minor fixes and a performance increase. There was absolutely nothing done to patch the critical issues in Verus.

### Poorly written checks
  - Frequently, client developers are able to find blazing fast flies, disablers, speeds, and FastBows. These are not typically patched, as the Verus developers have absolutely no idea what they are doing in terms of AntiCheat development. If you're here to paste some of Verus's code, you'll be subject to the same issues they have.

### False claims

### Lies & Misleading information

  Sources:
    - Verus MCM thread
    - https://imgur.com/a/QYIKVzz - Used to be on Verus's thread

  - In their MCM thread, they claim to offer "Priority support via discord and/or telegram". This is completely untrue, as one of the most common complains on the MC-Market thread is the total lack of support.
  - "Secure access to our authentication servers" *proceeds to literally get cracked in 10 minutes, then deobfuscated, then source leaked*
  - "Maximum performance, handle thousands of players on a single instance with absolutely no overhead" - In my testing, this is false. Furthermore, there's no proof provided of this ambitious claim.
  - "Compatability, support clients and servers on versions 1.7x-1.16x". Yet another lie, however there's some truth to this. The claim in this is that it works on 1.7 through 1.16, however it does not seem to support 1.9, 1.10, or 1.13. 
  - "Informative and useful GUI, control checks and much more" - Not necessarily true, all yuo can really do is control checks and restart the server. More of an exaggeration than a lie, though still important.
  - "Client detection, prevent a handful of the latest cracked clients before they even start to cheat" - If by this they mean cracked Vape V3, then sure, they detect that, though again, another exaggeration. There's no "latest cracked client" that they detect.
  - "Prevent all sorts of crash methods before they even get the chance to affect your server" - It's amazing how they claim to patch crashers, yet there are crashers that exist by abusing their own anticrash.
  - "Verus has the 3 main things an anticheat should have: Detectability, Scalability, and Reliability. These are 3 very basic concepts, yet other solutions on the market struggle with them, whereas Verus does not." - Verus doesn't have the detectability it claims to possess. Neither does it have the reliability it claims. Instead, it offers mediocre to low quality checks and dozens of false claims and exaggerations.
  - "Regular is made to detect blatant cheats, Premium adds the capability to detect modern/ghost cheats." - Verus's ghost detections are a joke. I genuinely don't know how this AntiCheat dares to call checks that can be easily falsed while boasting about Vape V2 and V3 detections.
  - Verus's only support staff, Botings, stated that "verus has been doing non public updates", however, when confronted with evidence to the contrary (a screenshot of Jacob stating that Verus hadn't been touched in months), he completely ignored the message. Evidence: https://imgur.com/a/wcnh5jA
  - More to be added soon

## Important To-Do
- ~~Fixup VerusTypeLoader class (Prob recode it)~~
- Check base command classes again.
- ~~Check KillauraQ (Premium Check) again~~
