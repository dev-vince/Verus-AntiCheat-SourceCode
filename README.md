# Verus AntiCheat SourceCode
### (VOSP) Verus-Open-Source-Project
!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

There is still shit to be done, but most stuff is there already.

# Why are you doing this?
I'm doing this because i won't watch how they continue scamming their customer. So you have 3 options,
- Shutdown Verus
- Ignore this (and I won't stop)
- Pay me 350$ to stop this.


Verus is a complete scam. There's absolutely no way to deny this. In this repository, you'll find some of the worst checks to ever be sold in a "premium" AntiCheat, though the verus developers don't see it that way. One of the Verus developers himself, Jacob, called Verus one of the best AntiCheats. Let's talk about why this is false.

### GroundSpoof
  - Toggle GroundSpoof and set your motionY to zero. You can fly at base move speed. For an AntiCheat of this price, this is absolutely unacceptable. I was able to replicate this with success using Wurst client.

### Updates
  - Verus lacks updates, severely. When it does update, critical issues are not fixed. Verus updated days ago, after around 3 and a half months of being completely MIA.

### Poorly written checks
  - Frequently, client developers are able to find blazing fast flies, disablers, speeds, and FastBows. These are not typically patched, as the Verus developers have absolutely no idea what they are doing in terms of AntiCheat development. If you're here to paste some of Verus's code, you'll be subject to the same issues they have.

## Important To-Do
- Fixup VerusTypeLoader class (Prob recode it)
- Check base command classes again.
- Check KillauraQ (Premium Check) again
