# Verus AntiCheat SourceCode
### (VOSP) Verus-Open-Source-Project
!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

There is still shit to be done, but most stuff is there already.

# Why are youdoing this?
I'm doing this because i won't watch how they continue scamming their customer. So you have 3 options,
- Shutdown Verus
- Ignore this
- Pay me 350$ to stop this.

## Important To-Do
- Fixup VerusTypeLoader class (Prob recode it)
- Check base command classes again.
- Check KillauraQ (Premium Check) again

## Credits
- brownie (Cracking, Dumping, Deobfuscating, Fixing decompiled code)
- FlyCode (Cleanup, Fixing decompiled code)
- Newb (Fixing decompiled code)
